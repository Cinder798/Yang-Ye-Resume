Hello, I'm **Ye Yang (Cinder)** — a linguist, language thinker, and NLP enthusiast.

> “Language is the map of the world, and communication is the bridge.”

I’m currently a Master of English Language Studies candidate at University of Malaya. My research focuses on *pragmatics, speech acts, and how language encodes power in Chinese culture* — particularly through food.

I believe language is not a static system, but a living energy that shifts with social intentions, identities, and silence. My personal motto is:
